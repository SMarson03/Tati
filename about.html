                    <p style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;text-align: center;width: auto;">Majority of my art work has evolving meanings, stemming from dreams and visions that come to me. I use my imagination and materials to illustrate what I’ve seen and experienced. Think of the canvas as a “room” and as you engage with my work, a conversation is being had in this space I’ve created.
                        Sometimes they can be interpreted premonitions of the future. Many of times I look back at them in shock, life occurs as it does; and here my painting is “speaking sound sentiments”. I’ve started viewing painting as 50% intention and the meaning will come later, but subconsciously I will always know.</p>
